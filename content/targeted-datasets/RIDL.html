intro: "The Raw Internal Data Library (RIDL) is UNHCR’s secure globally-supported space for indexing, versioning and storing data that is collected or managed outside of the corporate data systems. This includes most of UNHCR’s protection assessment and monitoring data, as there are no corporate systems for anonymized or personally identifiable operational microdata."
