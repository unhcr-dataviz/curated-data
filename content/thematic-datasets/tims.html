intro: "The Technical Information Management Systems (TIMS) is a web-based tool that allows users to manage critical data related to the technical components of a comprehensive response in displacement settings. Users can collect information on settlement planning, shelter, energy, environment, and WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) and analyse the data with user-friendly visualization and GIS tools. TIMS is a “one stop” data collection and monitoring system. TIMS helps field, country and regional offices leverage technical information to improve evidence-based strategic planning, reporting and advocacy."
